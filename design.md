Design Document for FIFA World Cup 2026 Web Application

Overview

This document provides a technical overview of the FIFA World Cup 2026 web application, explaining the key design decisions and the rationale behind them. The application is intended to provide users with detailed information about the World Cup, including historical data, stadium details, and state-wise hosting information.

Technical Stack

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: Flask (Python)
Database: SQLite

Frontend Design

HTML and CSS: Used to structure and style the web pages. The decision to keep the frontend simple and lightweight ensures faster load times and greater accessibility.
JavaScript: Employed for dynamic content manipulation, particularly in the home page's stadium dropdown feature, where stadium images change based on user selection.

Backend Design

Flask: Chosen for its simplicity and Pythonic nature, Flask facilitates quick development with enough flexibility to scale for future enhancements. It efficiently handles routing, requests, and server-side logic.
SQLite Database: SQLite is used to store information about the states, stadiums, and historical World Cup data. Its lightweight nature and ease of integration with Flask make it an ideal choice for this project.

Database Design
The database schema is optimized for quick retrieval of state and stadium information.
Relationships are designed to minimize redundancy and facilitate easy updates to stadium data.

Design Decisions
User Interface: A clean and intuitive interface was a priority to ensure ease of use for a diverse audience, including those with limited tech-savvy.
Responsive Design: CSS media queries ensure the application is usable across various devices, acknowledging the wide range of devices used to access web applications today.
Data Storage and Retrieval: The choice of SQLite and its schema design reflect the need for speed and efficiency in data handling, crucial for a smooth user experience.
Scalability and Maintainability: The application's structure allows for easy updates and scalability, particularly useful for accommodating future World Cup events or additional features.

Challenges and Solutions
Dynamic Content on Home Page: Implementing the dynamic display of stadium images based on dropdown selection posed a challenge. This was resolved using JavaScript to modify the DOM based on user input.
Database Integration: I worked carefully to make sure that the Flask backend (the part of the application that runs on the server) and the SQLite database (where the data is stored) work well together. It was important to plan how to ask for data from the database in a way that is fast and doesn't cause delays.

The design of the FIFA World Cup 2026 web application is a result of thoughtful consideration of user experience, data management, and scalability. The technical choices and design strategies were driven by the goal of creating an informative, user-friendly, and responsive resource for World Cup enthusiasts.
