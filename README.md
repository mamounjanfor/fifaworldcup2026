##Introduction

This project is a web application designed to display the stadiums for the FIFA World Cup 2026. It features detailed information about various stadiums, including images, capacities, and locations. The application is developed using Flask, a Python web framework, and incorporates front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a dynamic user experience.

A key component of this project is the use of SQLite, a lightweight database, to store and manage data regarding the states that will be hosting the World Cup matches. This data is prominently utilized in the 'States' page of the application, providing users with insightful information about each hosting location.

##Requirements
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:
Python 3
Flask
SQLite3

##Run the Flask Application
flask run
the application will run on the local host "http://127.0.0.1:5000"

##Usage

Navigating the Application:

Home
The 'Home' section serves as the landing page of the application. It provides a welcoming introduction to the project and may include key information or updates related to the World Cup 2026.

History
Selecting 'History' from the menu takes users to a page dedicated to the rich heritage of the FIFA World Cup. This page displays a comprehensive table listing all the countries that have hosted the World Cup in the past, alongside the winners of each tournament. This historical overview allows users to gain insights into the legacy and recurring patterns in World Cup history.

States
The 'States' section is designed to inform users about the specific states in the USA that will be hosting the World Cup 2026 matches. It features a detailed table listing each state, the corresponding stadiums located there, their capacities, and the cities they are in. This section is particularly useful for understanding the geographical spread and scale of the tournament across the United States.

Stadiums
In the 'Stadiums' section, users are presented with a visual and informational treat. This part of the application showcases each stadium that will host the World Cup matches. For each stadium, users can view an image, learn about its location (city), and see its seating capacity. This section is great for fans and visitors who want to learn more about where the matches will be played and what these iconic stadiums look like.
